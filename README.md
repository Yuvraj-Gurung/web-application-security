# Web Application Penetration Testing

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to conduct a penetration testing on a simulated web application to identify and exploit vulnerabilities.

## Objectives
1. Identify and exploit vulnerabilities within the web application.
2. Assess the potential impact of discovered vulnerabilities.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Burp Suite**: Used for web application security testing and vulnerability scanning.
- **OWASP ZAP**: Employed for automated security testing and identifying common vulnerabilities.
- **SQLmap**: Utilized for detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws.
- **Nmap**: Used for network scanning and reconnaissance.

## Methodology
### 1. Reconnaissance
- Conducted initial reconnaissance using **Nmap** to identify open ports and services running on the web server.
- Gathered information about the web application, including technologies used, server details, and potential entry points.

### 2. Vulnerability Scanning
- Utilized **Burp Suite** and **OWASP ZAP** to perform automated vulnerability scans on the web application.
- Identified common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and security misconfigurations.

### 3. Manual Testing
- Conducted manual testing to verify the findings from automated scans and to identify additional vulnerabilities.
- Exploited SQL injection vulnerabilities using **SQLmap** to demonstrate the potential impact.
- Tested for XSS vulnerabilities by injecting malicious scripts and verifying the execution on the client-side.

### 4. Exploitation
- Exploited identified vulnerabilities to assess their impact on the web application.
- Demonstrated the ability to gain unauthorized access, extract sensitive data, and perform actions on behalf of authenticated users.

### 5. Key Findings
- **SQL Injection**: Identified several SQL injection vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to access and manipulate the database.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Discovered XSS vulnerabilities that could enable attackers to execute malicious scripts in users' browsers.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Found CSRF vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Security Misconfigurations**: Detected various security misconfigurations, such as outdated software versions and exposed sensitive files.

## Conclusion
The web application penetration testing project successfully identified multiple security weaknesses within the Web applications.
